# IMDWho?

A very simple app built with the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com">Slim Framework</a> and <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> consumed by <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle">Guzzle</a>. Find the name of an actor by entering two films they've been in. If I could access the IMDB data this might actually be useful.
